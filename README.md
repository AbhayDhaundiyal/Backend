# Tasks

<h2>Task 1 : </h2>  <b>To input the data and verify it's content and then save it into the database.</b> For this task I made a backend api for taking the data using <b>Flask</b> and then verified the contents of it and then used <b>sqlalchemy</b> for storing the data in the database.

<h2>The main task</h2> <b>To analyse the data and find the point of inflextion for analysing the general trend of market and give signals according to it.</b> For this task I implemented the <b>Simple Moving Average Crossover Technique</b> to find the points of inflextion, now I categorized these points in two categories i.e. <b>Buy</b> and <b>Sell</b> now if our short term curve becomes greater than our long term I marked it as a buy signal and for the opposite its Sell signal.
